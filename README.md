## Recommendations 

- The company's main focus should be on the Office Supplies sub-category with Bidners and Paper being the highest selling and msot profitable. 
- Selling Copiers and Machines will yield us the least amount of profit. On the other hand, they may be able to bundle paper with copiers as paper seems to be the msot profitabel category. 
- Another thing we can conclude is that there should be deals on selling binders and paper as they go together and are the msot profitable by far. 
- Consumers make up the largest segment of the customer base and should be the ones we target the most. 
- The main focus should be on the top 10 cities with the highest sales with our marketing. 
- For categories with the lowest sales, we should focus on discounts and bundling to be able to sell them.
